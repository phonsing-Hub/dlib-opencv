# Face Recognition with Landmark Detection

This project uses OpenCV and dlib libraries to perform face recognition and landmark detection on images. It detects faces in images, computes face encodings, and compares them to determine if they match.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- dlib
- numpy

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
